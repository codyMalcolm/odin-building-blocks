# Building Blocks

## About

This is a collection of projects for the Odin Project. Read more about the projects [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks).

There's not much to say about these. For the Caesar cipher, the "tests" are a description. For the stock picker, in the result of a tie, the match with the last buy date is the result that is returned. It always makes a buy, even if a loss is unavoidable. For all three projects, I left the informal tests in.
